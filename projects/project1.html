                <p>
                    The TFT team builder was built to help new players figure out team comps for a game released by Riot Games called
                    Teamfight Tactics. I was learning React.js and Redux and thought it would be cool if I could create something useful
                    with it. This was my first and only time, so far, to build something with React.js, so as one might imagine, it's far from
                    perfect, but it was the first online application that I was proud of and that actually looked like an online app.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The app is organized in 4 logical sections, a list of all champions, a list of champions in your team, a list of buffs
                    you currently have, and a list of champions you need to complete specific buffs. You start off by selecting your team and then
                    the application will suggest you which champions you need to complete specific buff. Champions can be added to your team
                    either by selecting one from a list of all champions or by selecting a champion in suggested list. You can also remove
                    champions from your current team simply by clicking on them. To see what certain buffs do just hover their icons.
