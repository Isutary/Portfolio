                <p>
                    The Polynomial Calculator was originally a school project that was focused on implementing efficient algorithms for
                    operations with polynomials. It made use of binary search, divide and conquer, and recursion techniques. It was written
                    in C++. I decided to go one step further and created the UI for it. UI was created using RAD Studios C++ Builder, and
                    was the first time I created UI for application written in C++.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To start using Polynomial calculator just open Polinom.exe and you will see 3 input fields, Polinom 1, Polinom 2, and
                    Stepen. You will also see a keyboard with options to enter numbers and to perform basic operations. You start off by
                    entering 2 polynomials of form x^2+2x+1 and then choose which operation you want to perform. The result will be shown in
                    Rezultat field.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The calculator also has the ability to calculate the roots of polynomial and intersection of two input polynomials.
                    Simply enter the range [a, b] in which root/intersection is and press '?' next to it. Intersection and roots are
                    calculated by binary search so the result might not be exact value.
                </p>
