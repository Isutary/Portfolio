                        The TFT team builder was built to help new players figure out team comps for a game released by Riot Games called
                        Teamfight Tactics. I was learning React.js and Redux and thought it would be cool if I could create something useful
                        with it. This was my first and only time, so far, to build something with React.js, so as one might imagine, it's far from
                        perfect, but it was the first online application that I was proud of and that actually looked like an online app.

                        The Polynomial Calculator was originally a school project that was focused on implementing efficient algorithms for
                        operations with polynomials. It made use of binary search, divide and conquer, and recursion techniques. It was written
                        in C++. I decided to go one step further and created the UI for it. UI was created using RAD Studios C++ Builder, and
                        was the first time I created UI for application written in C++.

                        The TicTacToe game (or as it's called in my native language X-O) was a school project and was written in Python. We were
                        tasked with creating a simple console-based game of TicTacToe, however, I wanted it to feel natural so I created the UI
                        for it with the pythons turtle module. It was the first time ever I created something with the UI.

                        The Library is a backend for an application that might be used for website about books and authors. It was created in
                        ASP.net core and it follows RESTful principles. After gaining knowledge about ASP.net and RESTful, I wanted to see if I
                        could create an application that would be as close to production level as possible. In the end, I created CRUD
                        operations, authorization, and authentication for it in a RESTful manner.
