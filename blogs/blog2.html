                    <p>
                      After deciding to take a break from college I knew it was time to start looking for a job. Before I could do that I had
                      to expand my skillset. After spending two months learning about web development I could start applying for jobs, not so
                      much in hope of getting one as to get introduced to the whole job-seeking world.
                    </p>
                    <span id="partTwo"> First interview </span>
                    <p>
                      The first interview I ever did was at a company called QSS. The position was a junior software developer. It was the
                      first time I went to Vogosca so that alone was scary enough. I remember arriving half an hour early and being amazed by
                      their workspace. The interview was very informal, we just sort of talked for a while, however, I focused on not being
                      nervous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After the interview, I called my brother about it and was very happy with how it all went. After the initial euphoria
                      passed, I realized how little I knew and how much more there is still to learn. Maybe the best course of action was to
                      try to get an internship.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Over the course of the next year, I widened my skill sets and applied to pretty much anything I could. Even though I
                      didn't manage to get an internship or a job I was glad to see improvement in my interviewing skills and that I got much
                      better at the technical parts of the interview.
                    </p>
                    <span id="partThree"> First job </span>
                    <p>
                      I was 'enjoying' Covid-19 lockdown when my brother called me to say that one of his friends is looking for a QA
                      Engineer. It may not have been what I wanted to do, but I figured it would give me the opportunity to learn about
                      production-level applications, so I gladly accepted. I have been working as a QA Engineer for the past 6 months, where
                      my primary role was manual testing and QA of CMS for an online game of Rock-Paper-Scissors. I have also been responsible
                      for automation testing of the same website. Through automation testing, I was introduced to Atata framework, selenium
                      and some options for automation testing of RESTful APIs. Due to the nature of the job I had a lot of free time, which I
                      invested in expanding my knowledge of web development. I also got familiar with agile development. I hope that I will 
                      soon be ready to start working as a junior software developer.
