                    <p>
                        I began my formal education in 2003 in primary school
                        'Grbavica 2'. Ever since I was in primary school, I knew that my life goal was to become a programmer. I enjoyed playing
                        video games and was always fascinated by the mechanisms that made them possible. I continued my formal education in the 'Third gymnasium' in Sarajevo, where I picked
                        subjects that focused on math and programming. In 2015 I enrolled in the Faculty of Science at University of Sarajevo.
                        After finishing 2 years and some disagreements with one of the professors I decided to take a break from it which ended
                        up lasting 2 years during which I focused on learning web development. In 2020 I continued my college education.

                    <span id="partTwo"> Informal education </span>
                    <p>
                        During my break from college, I decided to learn about web development. I started off by learning about JavaScript.
                        Literature that I used was You Don't Know JS: by Kyle Simpson and Eloquent JavaScript by Marijn Haverbeke. Afterward, I
                        started learning HTML from a book by Matthew MacDonald, HTML5: The Missing Manual and CSS from a book by David
                        McFarland, CSS: The Missing Manual. At this point I was able to create my first website. I choose to create a website
                        for an online game of Teamfight Tactics. A website I ended up creating can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Isutary/tft-team-builder" target="_blank"> <b> Github </b> <i class="fab fa-github-square"></i> </a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Next natural step was to expand my knowledge by learning about some production-level tools for web development. Sass and
                        React.js seemed interesting, so I choose those. I learned React.js from a book by Alex Banks and Eve Porcello, Learning
                        React: Functional Web Development with React and Redux and Sass from online tutorials. Now that I have expanded my
                        knowledge I decided to remake Teamfight tactics website with better coding practices. New website can be found <a href="https://tft-team-builder.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"> <b> here </b> <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i> </a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now that I have "mastered" frontend it was time to move on to backend. After doing some research and due to my prior
                        knowledge of C++, .Net was a natural choice. Books of choice for this were Pro C# 7: With .NET and .NET Core by Andrew
                        Troelsen and Philip Japikse and Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2 by Adam Freeman. First thing I did with my newly acquired skills
                        was to create <a href="https://github.com/Isutary/Portfolio" target="_blank"> <b> Portfolio </b> <i class="fab fa-github-square"></i> </a>.
                    </p>
                    <span id="partThree"> Work experience </span>
                    <p>
                        <table>
                            <tr>
                                <th> Start date </th>
                                <th> End date </th>
                                <th> Company </th>
                                <th> Position </th>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td> June 2020 </td>
                                <td> Still working </td>
                                <td> Infinity Mesh </td>
                                <td> QA Engineer </td>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </p>
                    <span id="partFour"> Personal information </span>
                    <p>
                        I was born on 15.09.1996 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. My childhood was ordinary. I played outside with my
                        friends. enjoyed video games and hated school. As I grew up I started to like idea of learning it became something I do
                        on my own. I like doing math, playing chess and video games. I hang out with my friends and smoke hookah.
